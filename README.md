<h4 align="justify">Project Idea and Problem regarding this issue :</h4>
<p align="justify">The point of sale is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed. At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer, and indicates the options for the customer to make payment. The owner also can count all the sold or stored item and can update the bar code for all product. So, everything can be under controlled by the owner. In a super shop store, all product for sale is stored in the self so that customer can buy it by their own .For this a issue can arise if the shop owner doesn’t have any accounting of the selling product and owner can be deceived by the salesman of the shop. </p><br><br>
